Welcome to my new blog! This is where I'll be documenting my journey through AI development, software engineering, and the many lessons learned along the way.

## Why Start a Blog?

As a senior software developer, I've found that the best way to solidify learning is to write about it. This blog serves as my public notebook - a place to organize thoughts, share insights, and contribute to the broader developer community.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **AI Development** - From prompt engineering to building AI-powered applications
- **Software Architecture** - Design decisions, patterns, and trade-offs
- **Development Practices** - Tools, workflows, and productivity tips
- **Learnings** - Book summaries, course notes, and reflections

## A Quick Code Example

Since this is a developer blog, here's a simple example to verify syntax highlighting works:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Generate a personalized greeting."""
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to the blog."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(greet("Reader"))
```

And some JavaScript for good measure:

```javascript
const fetchLatestPosts = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/posts');
  const posts = await response.json();
  return posts.filter(post => post.published);
};
```

## Stay Tuned

I'm excited to share this journey with you. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spencer-shupe) if you have questions or want to connect.

Happy coding!
