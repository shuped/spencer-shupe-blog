## About Me

I'm Spencer Shupe, a senior software developer based in Kelowna, BC, Canada. I work at QHR Technologies, where I focus on product engineering with full-stack thinking and end-to-end ownership.

## What I Write About

This blog is my space to document learnings and share insights as I explore:

- **AI Development** - Working with AI models, prompt engineering, AI-assisted development tools, and the evolving landscape of AI in software
- **Software Engineering** - Architecture decisions, code quality, development practices, and lessons learned from building real systems
- **Learnings** - General notes, book summaries, and reflections on the craft of software development

## Why This Blog

In software development, I've found that writing things down helps me learn and retain information better. This blog serves as my public notebook - a place to organize my thoughts and share them with others who might find them useful.
