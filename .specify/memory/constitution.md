# Spencer Shupe Blog Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content-First
The blog exists to share knowledge and learnings. All technical decisions must serve content readability, discoverability, and author experience. Performance and aesthetics support content, not the other way around.

### II. Professional Presentation
The blog represents a senior software developer's personal brand. Design must be clean, modern, and professional - suitable for linking from LinkedIn. No gimmicks, excessive animations, or cluttered layouts.

### III. Simplicity Over Complexity
Use the simplest solution that works. Prefer static generation over dynamic content. Minimize dependencies and build complexity. A blog should be easy to maintain and post to.

### IV. Developer Experience
Adding a new blog post should be straightforward - write markdown, commit, publish. The workflow must support a busy developer's schedule without friction.

### V. Performance & Accessibility
Pages must load fast and work for everyone. Semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchy, good contrast, and mobile responsiveness are non-negotiable.

## Technology Constraints

- Static site generation for GitHub Pages hosting
- Markdown for content authoring
- GitHub Actions for automated deployment
- Minimal JavaScript - progressive enhancement only
- CSS that works without a build step when possible

## Content Structure

- Posts organized by date
- Clear categorization for different topics (AI, Development, Learnings)
- Proper metadata for SEO and social sharing
- Author information consistent with professional identity

## Governance

This constitution guides all development decisions for the blog. Changes require documentation and clear rationale.
